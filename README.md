This project represents a culmination of several advanced web development concepts, resulting in a robust, browser-based text editor application. As a fully realized Progressive Web App (PWA), the editor offers seamless online and offline functionality. One of the main highlights of the project is its innovative use of multiple data persistence techniques to ensure reliable data storage and accessibility. The application leverages the IndexedDB API through the use of 'idb', a lightweight package trusted by Google and Mozilla, offering advanced data retrieval and storage methods. Deployed on Heroku, this project epitomizes the principles of full-stack development, with a special focus on data persistence and progressive web app standards.

## Usage Information
Launch: Access the text editor through the browser by visiting the deployed link. If you want to use it offline, add the application to your home screen. On supported devices, the browser will prompt you to install the application.

Creating a new document: Click on the "New Document" button or select the appropriate option from the menu. A new blank text editing space will appear, where you can start typing your document.

Editing a document: Just click inside the text editing space and start typing. The text editor will save your progress in real-time, using various data persistence techniques to ensure that your work is not lost.

Saving your document: No need to manually save your document - the application automatically saves your work in real time. Your document is stored safely in an IndexedDB database.

Accessing your document offline: If you are offline, you can still access your saved documents. Just open the application, and your documents will be available for you to view and edit. Any changes you make while offline will be saved and synced when you are back online.
